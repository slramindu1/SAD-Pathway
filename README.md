## Introduction
This roadmap outlines the key steps and phases involved in developing a software application. It is designed to guide developers and teams through the entire process, from planning to maintenance.

## Project Planning
- **Requirement Gathering:** Understand the client's needs and gather requirements.
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine the project's technical, operational, and financial feasibility.
- **Project Timeline:** Establish a timeline with milestones for each phase.
- **Tech Stack Selection:** Choose appropriate technologies, frameworks, and tools.

## Design and Architecture
- **System Design:** Create a high-level design outlining system components, modules, and data flow.
- **User Interface (UI) Design:** Develop wireframes and prototypes for the UI.
- **Database Design:** Structure the database schema and relationships.
